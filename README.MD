## What is it?
A simple way to make a downloadable file tree. Just drag the one single PHP file to the directory of your choice and voila!

## Troubleshooting
### Some of my files arent showing up!
Gabe's file lister blocks the following files from appearing in the tree: `gabesFileLister.php` `gabesFileListerMin.php` `.DS_Store` `index.php` `files.php`

### Can I add files to exclude?
Yes! Just add the filename to the array here:

### Can I change X?
Yes! This is open-source! Change it however you want, I'm not the boss of you.
